## Features

**_Entering a new game, with the name of the player a game room can be created, a fetch is made to the API where the room is created in Firebase and an easy-to-manipulate code is returned to access the created room._**

**_Rock-paper-scissors can then be played online when a second player enters the created room.
You can only re-enter the room with the code and names used in the first game._**

**_The history of the game will take forever_**

## Why I did it ?

Actually this project is a remake of another project on the same game that had been built with Typescript only, the first time when I built it, it helped me a lot to integrate even better the concepts of asynchrony and use different databases.

## How did I build it ?

As I already said, the original project was built with Typescript, but it was time to use even better tools and thus perceive how incredible they are, in this project I used React as the main framework.

## Installation

Use the package manager yarn or npm to install the project.

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
npm install && npm run dev
```

## How to use

Apart from doing the installations, it is necessary to add the environment variables, in the **.env.example** file the necessary variables are declared for the project to work, they are mainly related to the Firebase database.
