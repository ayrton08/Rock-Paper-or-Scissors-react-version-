# Rock, Paper or Sccisors

Rock, Paper or Sccisors is an online game based on the concept of rooms.

## Why I did it ?

Actually this project is a remake of another project on the same game that had been built with Vanilla Javascript, the first time when I built it, it helped me a lot to integrate even better the concepts of asynchrony and use different databases.

## How did I build it ?

As I already said, the original project was built with Vanilla Javascript, but it was time to use even better tools and thus perceive how incredible they are, in this project I used React as the main framework

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn] or [npm] to install the project.

```
